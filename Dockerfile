# How To Create a Minimal Docker Base Layer in 10 Easy Steps
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# 1. Create a JeOS with SUSE Studio (https://susestudio.com)
#
# 2. Build and download the USB Stick / Hard Disk Image
#
# 3. Unpackage the image file
#      tar zxvf <image.tar.gz>
#
# 4. Run
#      fdisk -l <image file.raw>
#    to get the image file's configuration, paying attention to the file system
#    type, "sector size" and "start" sector. Your offset into the image will be
#    "start sector" and "sector size", f.ex:
#      start sector:  2048
#     *sector size:    512
#     =img offset: 1048576
#
# 5. Loop mount the file system:
#       sudo mount -t <type> -o ro,loop,offset=<offset> <image.raw> /mnt/temp
#
# 6. Package the content into a tar gz file:
#       sudo tar -C /mnt/temp -c . > rootfs.tar
#       gzip rootfs.tar
#
# 7. Setup Dockerfile with the full rootfs, and add a script with packages you
#    want to remove, and other cleanups and fixes you want to do:
#       FROM scratch
#       ADD rootfs.tar.gz /
#       COPY sles11sp4_minimize.sh /root/
#       RUN chmod 0755 /root/sles11sp4_minimize.sh
#
# 8. Run
#       docker build .
#       docker run -ti <image> /bin/bash
#       $ /root/sles11sp4_minimize.sh
#
#    # Note: I personally like to leave my trail visible for people to see so
#    # they know what changes, have been made to the original image, and not do
#    # f.ex.
#    #  $ rm /root/sles11sp4_minimize.sh
#    #  $ history -c
#    # But, that's entirely up to you as an image maintainer of course.
#
#       $ exit
#
# 9. Export the container as a new base layer, and compress it as much as
#    possible for distribution:
#       docker export <container> > sles-11-sp4-x86_64.tar
#       xz -9 -e sles-11-sp4-x86_64.tar
#
# 10. Change Dockerfile to simply use the new image as its base
#

FROM scratch
ADD sles-11-sp4-x86_64.tar.xz /
